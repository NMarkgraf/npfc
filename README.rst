Norman’s Pandoc Filter Collection
=================================

History
-------

This origins of this project are the old *moreblocks* filters, written
by the author in 2015 in Haskel. In 2015 the autor tries to write some
lecture presenations for math using markdown and pandoc to create
PDF-Presentations via beamer and LaTeX.

As he wanted some better and different colors for his definitions,
theorems, exercises etc. without touching the tex-code he started using
pandoc-filters and Haskel.

This worked fine until pandoc changed the API in 0.17.0.3, so the ever
more growing changes in moreblocks.hs collapsed and a the author thought
it would be a nice idear to start rather fresh with Python3 and panflute
instead of Haskel.

So NPFC is a completly new version of the old **morblocks**-filter
(witch was written in Haskel) with much more filters to come.

What do you need?
-----------------

As this is now written in Pyhton, you need **Pyhton3** and **panflute**

You can find **Pyhton** here: (Phyton)[http://pyton.org] And you can
find **panfulte** here: (panflute
github)[https://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute]

I recommend **Pyhton3.5** or newer and the actual **panflute**!

First steps
-----------

After you have installed **Pyhton3.5** (or newer) and **panflute** via

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+git://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute.git

or

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install git+git://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute.git

you might start with **NPFC**.

Why Phyton3 and not Python2?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Really? - Did you asked that?

I guess you want to know, what to do if you have Python2 already
installed? - Well, install Python3 also and use both, as long, as you
can change compledly to **Python3**.

If you have both **Python2** and **Python3** please check the first
lines of the .py-files

As on my development system, the first list always looks like

.. code:: bash

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

because I have to use both Releases of **Python**.

If you just use **Python3** you can change them to:

.. code:: bash

    #!/usr/bin/env python

Why this filter?
----------------

When you write a lecture (esp. a math lecture) in Markdown and use
pandoc to create a LaTeX or LaTeX-beamer output, you might want not only
blocks, but have control over the type of blocks pandoc adds.

What does it do for you?
------------------------

Take a look at the following input:

.. code:: markdown

    #### from Vieta {.theorem}

    For a polynom $x^2+px+q$ with zeros $x_1$ and $x_2$, the formulars 
    $p = -(x_1+x_2)$ and $q=x_1 \cdot x_2$ always holds.

Normally this would lead to the following output:

.. code:: latex

    \begin{block}{from Vieta}
    For a polynom $x^2+px+q$ with zeros $x_1$ and $x_2$, the formulars 
    $p = -(x_1+x_2)$ and $q=x_1 \cdot x_2$ always holds.
    \end{block}

Using the pandoc-moreblock-filter, we map the option {.theorem} to the
*amslatex*-package enviroment

.. code:: latex

    \begin{theorem}...\end{theorem}

instead. so we get the output:

.. code:: latex

    \begin{theorem}[from Vieta]
    For a polynom $x^2+px+q$ with zeros $x_1$ and $x_2$, the formulars 
    $p = -(x_1+x_2)$ and $q=x_1 \cdot x_2$ always holds.
    \end{theorem}

as an output.

With the **{.endblock}** option it is even possible to end a block at
will. So the input

.. code:: markdown

    #### from Vieta {.theorem}

    For a polynom $x^2+px+q$ with zeros $x_1$ and $x_2$, the formulars 
    $p = -(x_1+x_2)$ and $q=x_1 \cdot x_2$ always holds.

    #### {.endblock}

    We can use this theorem to guess a root of 
    a polynom where p and q are integers. 

    ####  {.lemma}

    A root must allways be a divisor of $q$!

will lead to the output

.. code:: latex

    \begin{theorem}[from Vieta]
    For a polynom $x^2+px+q$ with zeros $x_1$ and $x_2$, the formulars 
    $p = -(x_1+x_2)$ and $q=x_1 \cdot x_2$ always holds.
    \end{theorem}

    We can use this theorem to guess a root of 
    a polynom where p and q are integers. 

    \begin{lemma}
    A root must allways be a divisor of $q$!
    \end{lemma}

How to use it with pandoc
-------------------------

Using this filter is easy, if you **Python3** and **panflute**
installed.

To test the filter you might use

.. code:: bash

    pandoc --from=markdown --to=json **test.md** | \ 
    ./moreblocks.py beamer | \
    pandoc --from=json --to=beamer -o **test.pdf**

or

.. code:: bash

    pandoc --from=markdown --to=beamer --filter moreblocks.py \
    **test.md** -o **test.pdf**

instead.

How does it work?
-----------------

Simple! - The filter seaches for a “{.theorem}”, “{.example}”,
“{.examples}”, “{.fact}”, … ,or “{.endblock}” option in the Markdown
block “####”, just like in the example above. This is replaced by a
RawLatexBlock or RawLatexInline in the *JSON* represenation of the
**AST** by

.. code:: latex

    \begin{Satz}...\end{Satz}

    \begin{Beispiel}...\end{Beispiel}

    \begin{Beispiele}...\end{Beispiele}

    etc.

You might change the options name in “moreblocks.py”. This all interacts
with the “moreblocks.tex” file in wich all new blocks are defined and
the color is set. You may also change the LateX theorem enviroment used
by YAML within the markdown-file:

.. code:: markdown
